I have been following this tutorial by Jason Brownlee on Deep Learning:
[see link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/)

The structure I realized is as follow:

1. Define the data or load your data. This essentially requires you have your data handy.
2. Define the model. I believe this is where one has to spend a lot of time thinking because this section is vast.
3. Train/Fit the model. This section becomes easy once you have step 2 done and ready.
4. Evaluate the model. I think that the task dictate what you are meant to do.
5. Using the model for prediction.

I will begin with step 2 because that is where I have to made up most of my time.
